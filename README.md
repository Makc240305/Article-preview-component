## How It Works

1. **HTML**:
   - A card layout contains the main content of the article.
   - A share button is positioned absolutely for modern aesthetics.

2. **CSS**:
   - Variables are used for colors, font sizes, and spacing.
   - `position: absolute` is used for the share button for precise placement.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Toggles the visibility of the share section when the "Share" button is clicked.
   - Detects clicks outside the component to hide the share section.
